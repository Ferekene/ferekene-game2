# Golden Fortune Slots - Deployment Guide

## Overview
Golden Fortune Slots is now fully integrated with Stake Engine RGS and Supabase. This guide covers deployment to Stake Engine platform.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- Stake Engine account with game configured
- Supabase project (already configured in .env)

## Environment Variables

The project uses the following environment variables (already configured in `.env`):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## Building for Production

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd Game/frontend
npm install
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

## Required URL Parameters

The game expects the following URL parameters from Stake Engine:

- `sessionID` (required) - Player session identifier
- `rgs_url` (required) - RGS server URL
- `lang` (optional) - Language code (default: 'en')
- `currency` (optional) - Currency code (default: 'USD')
- `device` (optional) - Device type (default: 'desktop')
- `demo` (optional) - Demo mode flag (default: false)
- `social` (optional) - Social casino flag (default: false)

Example URL:
```
https://your-game-url.com/?sessionID=abc123&rgs_url=rgs.twist-rgs.com&lang=en&currency=USD&device=desktop&demo=true
```

## Stake Engine Integration

### RGS Endpoints Used

The game communicates with the following RGS endpoints:

1. **Authentication** - `/wallet/authenticate`
   - Called on game load
   - Returns balance, config, and active round info

2. **Play** - `/wallet/play`
   - Called when player spins
   - Returns round results and updated balance

3. **End Round** - `/wallet/end-round`
   - Called after round processing completes
   - Finalizes the round on RGS

### Authentication Flow

1. Game loads and parses URL parameters
2. `Authenticate.svelte` component initializes
3. RGS authentication request sent
4. Response processed:
   - Balance updated
   - Bet levels configured
   - Active round resumed if exists
5. Game assets loaded
6. Game becomes playable

## Supabase Database

### Tables Created

1. **game_sessions** - Tracks player sessions
2. **game_rounds** - Records all game rounds
3. **error_logs** - Captures errors for debugging

### Data Persistence

- Session data saved on authentication
- Round data saved after each spin
- Errors logged automatically
- All writes are non-blocking (won't affect gameplay)

## Testing

### Local Testing with Stake Engine

You can test with Stake Engine by opening the URL they provide:

```
https://obsmachine.cdn.stake-engine.com/your-game-id/v2/index.html?sessionID=...&rgs_url=...
```

### Build Preview

Test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Note: Local preview won't work without URL parameters. You must test with Stake Engine URLs.

## Deployment to Stake Engine

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Upload the `build/` directory contents to Stake Engine:
   - Use Stake Engine's admin panel
   - Upload all files maintaining directory structure
   - Ensure `index.html` is at the root

3. Configure game settings in Stake Engine admin:
   - Set game name: "Golden Fortune"
   - Set game type: Slots
   - Configure bet levels
   - Set RTP and volatility
